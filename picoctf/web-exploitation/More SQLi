1. Try the same as in SQLiLite
2. Website shows Login Form --> after submitting, a SQL is shown --> This is shown 
    username: 123
    password: 123
    SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='123' AND password='123'
3.  We want to be the statement always true --> ' OR '1'='1 --> String closed, then we have an or with a always true statement and then let the String open 
4. This doesn't work here 
5. Set password to ' OR 1=1 -- because this is the first parameter in the where clause. --> the rest of the clause gets commented
6. Nothing to see on the new Website
7. When intercepting the website, there is a redirect, which contains the flag
