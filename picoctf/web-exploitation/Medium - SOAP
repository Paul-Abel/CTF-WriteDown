1. When opening the website, nothing interesting
2. Clicking on Details tricker a POST-Request with XML --> Because of the name, try to manipulate
3. Invalid XML and other IDs don't work, except for the 3 Details implemented. 
4. Tip: XML external entity Injection
5. Example from Chat GTP
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <!DOCTYPE data [
      <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
      ]>
      <data>&xxe;</data>
6. Intercept POST-Request and manipulate Input --> Only works if <ID> </ID> is added in XML.
