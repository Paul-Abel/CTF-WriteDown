1. Website shows Login Form --> after submitting, a SQL is shown --> This is shown 
  username: 123
  password: 123
  SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='123' AND password='123'
2. Input * for user and password doesn't work because its still a String
3. We want to be the statement always true --> ' OR '1'='1 --> String closed, then we have an or with a always true statement and then let the String open 
4. "Logged in! But can you see the flag, it is in plain sight." --> CTF is in HTML response
